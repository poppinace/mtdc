## Introduction
The MTDC dataset extends our previous MTC dataset with bounding box annotations that enable the evaluation of object detection frameworks.

## Highlights
- 361 field images collected from 4 experimental fields across China: Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China, Taian, Shandong Province, China, Gucheng, Hebei Province, China, and Jalaid, Sinkiang Autonomous Region, China.
- Six cultivars of maize plants: Jundan No.20, Nongda, No.108, Wuyue No.3, Zhengdan No.32, Jidan No.20, and Tianlong No.9.
- 13,562 bounding boxes annotations.
- The dataset is captured in the field with realistic visual challenges.

*Each image is associated with a standalone ".mat" annotation file that records the position of bounding boxes. The ".mat" files are created in Matlab.
